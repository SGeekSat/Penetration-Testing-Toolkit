# ABOUT

A Python based Penetration testing toolkit that is designed to assist security professionals and ethical hackers in performing security assessments. It is a modular toolkit, that combines several 

security capabilities into one single easy-to-use interface, making it efficient for vulnerability discovery and network analysis.

# FEATURES

- Modular Architecture: Easily extensible with separable modules for different testing functions.

- Command Line Interface: Simple terminal-based operations through main.py

- Comprehensive Reporting: Detailed output of discovered vulnerabilities and network information.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on Linux, Mac OS and Windows environments.

- Customized Configurations: Adjusts testing parameters to suit specific requirements.

# TOOLS

The toolkit includes the following modules-

- BruteForcer.py: Password brute-force capability for several services and protocols.

- PacketSniffer.py: This captures the network traffic and analysis functionality.

- PortScanner.py: TCP/UDP port scanning with service detection.

- SubdomainEnum.py: This finds the subdomain and does the enumeration for target domains based on subdomain.txt.

- VulScanner.py: This scans the vulnerability across web applications and network services.

- main.py: It is the central interface to access all the toolkit functions.

# ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.8+

- Requires the python packages listen in requirements.txt.

- Appropriate permission for network scanning and packet capturing.

- For complete functionality, root/administrator priviledges maybe required.

- Recommended: Virtual environment for dependency isolation.

# USAGE
- Install required dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt.

- Run the main interface main.py

- Select the desired module and follow the prompts.

- Reference subdomains.txt for custom domain lists and password.txt for brute force operations.

# Security Constraints

This toolkit is intended for legitimate security testing with proper authorization only. Unauthorized use against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

- Obtain written permission before testing any system or run on the your system of which you are the explicit owner.

- Follow responsible disclosure practices.

- Respect privacy and data protection regulations.

- Document all testing activities thoroughly.
